# ESP32 Remote-Controlled Servo Lock

An embedded C project using ESP-IDF to create a smart lock system controlled by an IR remote and operated with a servo motor.

##  Features

- Control a servo motor (door lock) using any standard IR remote
- Easily change the "unlock" button by updating the IR code in the code
- Low-cost, all off-the-shelf components
- Fully written in C for ESP32 using ESP-IDF (no Arduino code)
- Designed for learning, prototyping, or as a resume/portfolio project
